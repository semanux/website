> While innovation is often associated with profit maximization, it also plays a crucial role with regard to social developments. AI-based social innovations could potentially solve challenges in different areas, such as healthcare, climate and environmental protection, fairness, and education. AI expertise is valuable for societal actors such as NGOs and can give rise to non-profit social innovations. Until now, however, AI's positive societal impact has received too little attention. Cyber Valley intends to address this potential at "AI in Social Innovation & Impact", the next event in its Entrepreneurship Series. 

There will be five talks in the event, including times for questions and answers for each talk.
