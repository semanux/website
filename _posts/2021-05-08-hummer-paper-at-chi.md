In our research paper *"Hummer: Text Entry by Gaze and Hum"*, we have combined gaze control with humming sounds in a novel, hands-free text entry system. Our results were accepted for detailed publication and presentation **at the most important international conference on human-computer interaction**, CHI.

In many situations, touchless text input may be necessary - whether it is cooking, a short- or long-term injury, or even illness. Voice control could be a solution for text entry, but privacy is potentially compromised. In some cases, voice input may not even be possible for users due to the nature of their illness.

**We therefore combine buzzing sounds with gaze control via eye tracking for hands-free word-by-word text entry.** For this purpose, the user looks at the first letter of a word on the on-screen virtual keyboard, starts humming, looks over the other letters of the word, and ends the input of the word with the humming - fast, precise, and discrete. Our approach enabled testers to input over 20 words per minute without touching the keyboard, outperforming other current hands-free input methods. This convinced both the reviewers of our publication and the international audience of researchers during our presentation at the [*"2021 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems"*](https://chi2021.acm.org/) in May:

Association for Computing Machinery, New York, NY, USA, Article 741, 1â€“11. DOI:<https://doi.org/10.1145/3411764.3445501>

**We are planning to integrate this innovative way of text input into Semanux as well, thus providing our customers with faster, simpler and more reliable hands-free interaction based on the latest research findings.**
