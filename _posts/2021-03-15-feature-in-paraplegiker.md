A special section was dedicated to us in the current issue of *"PARAplegiker"* for spring 2021. PARAplegiker magazine is the **most important German-language magazine focusing on paraplegia.** It currently has a circulation of over 12,000 copies.

The magazine [*"PARAplegiker"*](https://www.fgq.de/news/der-paraplegiker) is published by the [Fördergemeinschaft der Querschnittgelähmten in Deutschland e.V. (FGQ)](https://www.fgq.de) on a quarterly basis. It is available in almost all facilities in Germany that specialize in the treatment of people with spinal paralysis. Thus, the article offers an excellent platform for us to get in contact with affected people and future pilot customers. We are already looking for testers for the beta versions of Semanux in order to be able **to consider the challenges and the wishes of customers in our development at the earliest possible stage.**
