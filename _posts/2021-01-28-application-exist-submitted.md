We have applied for funding through the EXIST transfer of research program. The program is offered by the [German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy](https://www.bmwi.de/Navigation/EN/Home/home.html) and partly funded through the [European Social Fund in Germany](https://www.esf.de/portal/EN/Home/home.html).

The funding through [EXIST](https://www.exist.de/EN/Programme/EXIST-Transfer-of-Research/content.html) would allow us to work for 18 months on the prototype of Semanux, while still being part of our research group of [Analytic Computing](https://www.ipvs.uni-stuttgart.de/departments/ac/) at the University of Stuttgart.
We have submitted a 25-page long description of Semanux, describing the innovation, our research, our team, our work plan, the market situation, and an initial business plan.

Specifically, we have applied for the first phase of funding that is described as the following:

> In the first phase, results of research that have the potential of becoming the basis of a start-up business are developed further. The objective is to carry out further resource development to clarify fundamental problems involved in converting academic findings into technical products and processes. The business concept based on these findings should be made into a business plan and the planned business start-up should be prepared systematically.

Moreover, we could persuade two mentors with our idea, who support our proposal for the EXSIT transfer of research. [Prof. Dr. Steffen Staab](https://www.ipvs.uni-stuttgart.de/institute/team/Staab-00001) supports us as a scientific mentor. He is the head of the Analytic Computing unit and one of the world's leading experts in the Semantic Web. [Prof. Dr. Brem](https://www.eni.uni-stuttgart.de/en/institute/team/Brem-00002) is the head of the [Institute of Entrepreneurship and Innovation Science](https://www.eni.uni-stuttgart.de/en/) at the University of Stuttgart and support us as a mentor in entrepreneurship.

In addition, we receive large support from startup coaches from the institute of entrepreneurship and innovation science at the University of Stuttgart and its [startup network](https://www.tti-stuttgart.de).

We expect a final decision about our application in July 2021!
