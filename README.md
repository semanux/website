# Website of the Semanux Project

New Website using Jekyll 4. Under construction.

## Local Setup

1. Install Ruby on your system: <https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation>.
1. Open Command Line / PowerShell / Bash / zsh.
1. Install the [bundler gem](https://bundler.io) for managing dependencies with `gem install bundler`.
1. Go to the directory where the repository should be cloned to with `cd directory/to/place/repo`.
1. Clone the repository with `git clone https://github.com/semanux/website.git semanux-website`.
1. Go into the directory of the repository `cd semanux-website`.
1. Install dependencies into a local vendor directory with `bundle install --path vendor`.
1. Optional: Run `npm install` to install node modules (currently tools for code autoformatting). Requires node.js installation.
1. Generate and serve the Web site with `bundle exec jekyll serve --livereload`. Alternatively you may use the shorthand `npm run serve` (requires node modules installed).
1. Optional: run `npm clean` to remove all files generated by Jekyll (requires node modules installed).
1. Optional: run `npm run check` to check the code formatting, run `npm run format` to automatically format the code (requires node modules installed).

## TODO
1. Style blog posts <https://www.xaprb.com/blog/how-to-style-images-with-markdown>
1. Visitor tracker
1. Imprint
1. Actually write news
1. Social media links
1. Redirect of semanux.de to semanux.com/de (similar to approach in Hugo version)
1. Create Email addresses as listed on the page
1. Integrate Matomo
1. CI script is both in main and in jekyll branch. Still confusing which one is actually used by GitHub
1. SASS: "cards" are highly similar, maybe let them share rules?

## Ideas
- List our relevant publications?
- Show gazetheweb? (or at least something about proved technology)
- Have authors of blog posts?
- Minify output of Jekyll (there is no Jekyll plugin available)
- Use jekyll-assets to generate thumbnails?

## Tipps
- Use double quotes (") to surround any relative link in HTML code (e.g., `<a href="/imprint">Imprint</a>`). Otherwise, localization of the relative link does not work.
